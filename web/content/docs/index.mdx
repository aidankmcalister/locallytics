## What is Locallytics?

Locallytics is a privacy-first analytics SDK that runs entirely on your infrastructure â€“ no external servers, no tracking scripts, no cost.

Drop in an `<AnalyticsGrabber />` component to collect data and use `AnalyticsJSON()` to fetch metrics, all powered by your own database and hosting.
