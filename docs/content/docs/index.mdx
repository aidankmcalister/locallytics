# Locallytics

**"Analytics that live with your app."**

Self-contained analytics SDK that runs entirely on your infrastructure – no external servers, no tracking scripts, no cost.

## Overview

Locallytics is a privacy-first analytics solution where developers drop in an `<AnalyticsGrabber />` component to collect data and use `AnalyticsJSON()` to fetch metrics, all powered by their own database and hosting.

## Key Features

- **Zero external dependencies** – data stays local on your infrastructure
- **One-line setup** using React components
- **Pageview + custom event tracking**
- **Works with any backend** (Vercel, Cloudflare, Supabase, Postgres, SQLite, etc.)
- **Privacy-compliant** and free forever
- **TypeScript-first** with full type safety
- **Kysely-based** database adapter with support for Postgres and SQLite

## Differentiators

- Competes with Plausible, Fathom, and PostHog
- "Better Auth for analytics" – everything runs in your app
- Open-source SDK
- Developer-first DX with TypeScript and modern tooling
